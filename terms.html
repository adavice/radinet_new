			<h1>Terms and conditions</h1>

			<div class="">

				<p>Please refer to the content guidelines for information regarding acceptable use of content.</p>
				<p>PLEASE READ THIS USER AGREEMENT (”AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY
					Radinet.net (”COMPANY”). BY CLICKING THE “SUBMIT” BOX, YOU AGREE TO BECOME BOUND BY THE TERMS AND
					CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
					CLICK ON THE “CANCEL” BUTTON AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO USE THE SERVICES OFFERED BY COMPANY.
					COMPANY’S ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ASSENT TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
					THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS; IF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN
					OFFER BY COMPANY, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THESE TERMS.</p>
				<p>The Web pages available at Radinet.net, and all linked pages unless indicated otherwise (”Site”), are
					owned and operated by Company, and are accessed by you (”User”) under the following terms and
					conditions: ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company
					may offer to provide certain services that relate to facilitating the purchase and sale of mobile
					advertisements by bringing together mobile advertisers and publishers, as described more fully on
					the Site, and which are selected by User through the process provided on the Site (”Services”).
					Company may change, suspend or discontinue the Services (or User’s access thereto) at any time,
					including the availability of any feature, advertisement, publisher or Content, without notice or
					liability. Company reserves the right, at its discretion, to refuse to allow access to the Services
					to any User at any time. Company also reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify this
					Agreement at any time by posting a notice on the Site, or by sending User a notice via email or
					postal mail. Use of the Services by User following such notification constitutes User’s acceptance
					of the modified terms and conditions. User certifies to Company that if User is an individual (i.e.,
					not a corporation) User is at least 18 years of age. User also certifies that it is legally
					permitted to use the Services and access the Site, and takes full responsibility for the selection
					and use of the Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the
					Site is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>
				<h2>Restrictions</h2>
				<p>User (whether a publisher, advertiser or otherwise) warrants, represents and agrees that it will not
					contribute, submit or make available through the Services, or use the Services in connection with,
					any Content that is infringing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, offensive or
					otherwise violates any law or right of any third party. If User is a publisher, User shall not, and
					shall not authorize or encourage any third party to generate fraudulent impressions of or fraudulent
					clicks on any advertisement, including but not limited to, through repeated manual clicks, the use
					of robots or other automated query tools and/or computer generated search requests, and/or the
					fraudulent use of other search engine optimization services and/or software. Company reserves the
					right to remove any Content from the Site at any time, or to terminate User’s right to use the
					Services or access the Site, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims
					or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if Company is concerned
					that User may have breached the terms of this paragraph), or for no reason at all, subject to the
					provisions of paragraph 13 (”Termination”). User is responsible for all of its activity in
					connection with the Services and accessing the Site. User may not post or transmit, or cause to be
					posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation designed or intended to obtain password,
					account, or private information from any Company user. User shall not use any part of the Site or
					Services to violate the security of any computer network, crack passwords or security encryption
					codes, transfer or store material that is deemed threatening or obscene, or engage in any kind of
					illegal activity. User will not run Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder, or “spam” on the
					Site or Services, or any processes that run or are activated while the User is not logged in.
				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				<p>Users who are publishers may list assets including but not limited to mobile sites, applications, and
					device platforms (”Mobile Properties”) and make them available for advertisement. Users who are
					publishers hereby grant Company the right to access, index and cache requests made from User’s
					Mobile Property to the Service, including by automated means. Users who are advertisers may produce
					content including but not limited to text links, banners, videos, and graphics (”Advertisements”)
					for display on a publisher’s Mobile Property. User agrees to comply with the technical
					specifications provided by Company to enable proper display of the Advertisements in connection with
					the Services.
				<h2>COMMUNICATIONS SOLELY WITH COMPANY</h2>
				<p>User agrees to direct to Company and not to any advertiser or publisher, as the case may be, all
					communications regarding any matter arising out of User’s use of the Services. Without limiting the
					foregoing, User shall not initiate any communication of any kind that encourages, solicits, induces,
					diverts, entices or otherwise takes away from Company the business or patronage of an advertiser or
					publisher of Company.</p>
				<h2>CONTENT</h2>
				<p>All materials displayed or performed on or accessible through the Site or Services (including, but
					not limited to text, graphics, articles, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips and video
					clips, also known as the “Content”) are protected by copyright. The term “Content” as used herein
					specifically includes any advertising or other content made available or submitted by any advertiser
					and any website or other content published by or associated with any publisher. User shall abide by
					all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed in connection
					with the Services.</p>
				<p>User acknowledges and agrees that if User uses any of the Services to contribute or make available
					Content, Company is hereby granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable right to
					fully exploit such Content (including all related intellectual property rights) and to allow others
					to do so in connection with the Services and the Site. To the extent allowed by law, the foregoing
					includes all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may
					be known as or referred to as “Moral Rights”. To the extent User retains any such Moral Rights under
					applicable law, User hereby ratifies and consents to any action that may be taken with respect to
					such moral rights by Company and agrees not to assert any Moral Rights with respect thereto.</p>
				<h2>DISCLAIMERS</h2>
				<p>User acknowledges and agrees that Company has no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to User
					and that Company has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding: which users gains
					access to the Site or Services; what Content User accesses or receives via the Site or Services;
					what Content other Users may make available, publish or promote in connection with the Services;
					what effects any Content may have on User or its users or customers; how User or its users or
					customers may interpret, view or use the Content; what actions User or its users or customers may
					take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, or whether Content is being displayed
					properly in connection with the Services.</p>
				<p>Further, (i) if User is a publisher, User specifically acknowledges and agrees that Company has no
					control over (and is merely a passive conduit with respect to) any Content that may be submitted or
					published by any advertiser, and that User is solely responsible (and assumes all liability and
					risk) for determining whether or not such Content is appropriate or acceptable to User, and (ii) if
					User is an advertiser, User specifically acknowledges and agrees that Company has no control over
					any Content that may be available or published on any publisher website (or otherwise), and that
					User is solely responsible (and assumes all liability and risk) for determining whether or not such
					Content is appropriate or acceptable to User.</p>
				<p>User releases Company from all liability in any way relating to User’s acquisition (or failure to
					acquire), provision, use or other activity with respect to Content in connection with the Site or
					Services. The Site may contain, or direct User to sites containing, information that some people may
					find offensive or inappropriate. Company makes no representations concerning any Content contained
					in or accessed through the Site or Services, and Company will not be responsible or liable for the
					accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed through the
					Site or Services. Company makes no guarantee regarding the level of impressions of or clicks on any
					Advertisement, or the timing of delivery of such impressions and/or clicks.</p>
				<p>THE SERVICES, CONTENT AND SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
					EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
					FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THE RESULTS OF USE OF
					THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RESULTS OF ANY ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN, AND USER
					ASSUMES ALL RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT THERETO. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON
					HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.</p>
				<p>Electronic Communications Privacy Act Notice (18 USC 2701-2711): COMPANY MAKES NO GUARANTY OF
					CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVACY OF ANY COMMUNICATION OR INFORMATION TRANSMITTED ON THE SITE OR ANY
					WEBSITE LINKED TO THE SITE OR THROUGH ANY USE OF THE SERVICES. Company will not be liable for the
					privacy of e-mail addresses, phone or communication device numbers, registration and identification
					information, disk space, communications, confidential or trade-secret information, or any other
					Content stored on its equipment and transmitted over networks accessed by the Site, or otherwise
					connected with User’s use of the Site or Services.
				</p>
				<h2>REGISTRATION AND SECURITY</h2>
				<p>As a condition to using Services, User may be required to register with Company and select a password
					and enter User’s email address (”Company User ID”). User shall provide Company with accurate,
					complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this
					Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of User’s account. User may not (i) select or
					use as a Company User ID a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii)
					use as a Company User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than User without
					appropriate authorization. Company reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a Company
					User ID in its discretion. User shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of User’s
					Company password.</p>
				<h2>EQUIPMENT AND ANCILLARY SERVICES</h2>
				<p>User shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to
					connect to, access the Site or otherwise use the Services, including, without limitation, hardware
					devices, software, and other Internet, wireless, broadband, phone or other communication device
					connection services. User shall be responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary
					services are compatible with the Site and any Services and User shall be responsible for all charges
					incurred in connection with all such equipment and ancillary services, including any fees charged
					for airtime usage and/or sending and receiving messages or related notifications.</p>
				<h2>INDEMNITY</h2>
				<p>User will indemnify and hold Company, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees,
					harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due
					to or arising out of User’s access to the Site, use of the Services, the violation of this Agreement
					by User, or the infringement by User, or any third party using the User’s account, of any
					intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.</p>
				<p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OR THE SERVICES
					(I) FOR ANY AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID BY USER THEREFOR; OR (II) FOR ANY
					INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER. SOME STATES DO NOT
					ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS
					AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.</p>
				<h2>FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
				<p>Some of the Services require payment of fees. Company reserves the right to change its price list and
					to institute new charges at any time, upon prior notice to User, which may be sent by email or
					posted on the Site. If User is an advertiser, User shall pre-pay all applicable fees, as described
					on the Site, in connection with such Services selected by User. If User is a publisher, User shall
					receive a percentage of the Net Revenue of Advertisements associated with User’s use of the Services
					as solely determined by Company. “Net Revenue” shall mean revenues actually received by Radinet.net
					from the sale, use or other disposition of Advertisements displayed on Publisher’s Mobile Property
					less sales, use and excise taxes, less any agency commissions, carrier and/or partner fees, and less
					any allowances actually made or taken for returns, cash discounts or promotional allowances but
					excluding other revenues indirectly earned, if applicable, for consulting, planning and targeting,
					copywriting, site building, account management or technical modifications or technical innovations
					which may be charged by Radinet.net to third parties from time to time. The portion of Net Revenue
					received by User shall be determined on the first Monday of each calendar month, on which day those
					revenues accrued to User’s account thirty (30) or more days earlier shall become eligible to be
					paid. Payments to User shall be sent by Company only if User’s earned balance is greater than or
					equal to $500USD (Five Hunderd Dollars, US). If User’s earned balance is less than $500USD, no
					payment shall be sent until the following calendar month, on the first Monday of which Company shall
					make the aforesaid determination anew. In addition, if User is a publisher, User agrees that any
					payments that may become due to User (as described on the Site) are specifically conditioned upon
					Company’s receipt of full payment from the applicable advertiser. If Company does not receive the
					applicable payment in full from any such advertiser, Company shall have no liability or
					responsibility to User (and User hereby releases Company) with respect thereto. If User disputes any
					payment made in connection with the Services, User must notify Company in writing within thirty (30)
					days of any such payment. Failure to so notify Company shall result in the waiver by User of any
					claims related to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records
					maintained by Company. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Company
					or have any effect under this Agreement. Company shall not be liable for any payment based on (i)
					any fraudulent impressions generated by any person, robot, automated program or similar device or
					for fraudulent impressions similarly generated on any advertisements, as reasonably determined by
					Company; (ii) impressions commingled with a significant number of fraudulent impressions or
					fraudulent clicks described in (i) above; or (iii) any breach of this Agreement by User. To ensure
					proper payment, User is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and
					payment information associated with User’s account and Company User ID. User agrees to pay all
					applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with User’s use of the
					Services.
				</p>
				<h2>OTHER POLICIES</h2>
				<p>In the course of using the Site or Services, User may be asked to provide certain personally
					identifiable information to Company (such information referred to hereinafter as “User
					Information”). Company’s information collection and use policies with respect to such User
					Information are set forth in the Site’s Privacy Policy which is incorporated herein by reference for
					all purposes. User acknowledges and agrees that User is solely responsible for the accuracy and
					content of its User Information. Company cannot and does not guarantee the security of any of the
					User Information that a User transmits online.</p>
				<p>Users who believe that material or Content residing on or accessible through the Site or Services
					infringes a copyright should review the Site’s Copyright Dispute Policy.</p>
				<h2>TERMINATION</h2>
				<p>Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the other party by any means.
					Company may also terminate or suspend any and all Services and access to the Site immediately,
					without prior notice or liability, if User breaches any of the terms or conditions of this
					Agreement. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable and non-cancelable. Upon termination of the
					User’s account, User’s right to use the Services will immediately cease and User will remove all
					Company code from User’s Mobile Properties. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature
					should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
					provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
				<h2>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h2>
				<p>If User is a publisher, User represents and warrants to Company that (i) User is the owner of each
					Mobile Property User designates in connection with the use of Services or that User is legally
					authorized to act on behalf of the owner of such Mobile Property for the purposes of this Agreement,
					and (ii) User has all necessary right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
					perform the acts required of User hereunder. User further represents and warrants to Company that

					laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations; (b) do not breach and have not breached any duty toward
					or rights of any person or entity including, without limitation, rights of intellectual property,
					publicity or privacy, or rights or duties under consumer protection, product liability, tort, or
					contract theories; and (c) are not hate-related in content. If User is an advertiser, User
					represents and warrants to Company that (i) User is the owner of each Advertisement User designates
					in connection with the use of Services or that User is legally authorized to act on behalf of the
					owner of such Advertisement for the purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) User has all necessary
					right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the acts required of User
					hereunder. User further represents and warrants to Company that each of User’s Advertisements and
					any material displayed therein: (a) comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and
					regulations; (b) do not breach and have not breached any duty toward or rights of any person or
					entity including, without limitation, rights of intellectual property, publicity or privacy, or
					rights or duties under consumer protection, product liability, tort, or contract theories; (c) are
					not hate-related in content and (d) are free from viruses and any other contaminants of any nature
					whatsoever.</p>
				<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
				<p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be
					deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to
					perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company’s
					reasonable control. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
					provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
					shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable,
					transferable or sublicensable by User except with Company’s prior written consent. This Agreement
					shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws without regard to the conflict of
					laws provisions thereof. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive
					statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written
					and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this
					Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as
					otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a
					result of this Agreement and User does not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any
					respect whatsoever.
