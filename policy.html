			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

			<p><span>1. Responsible body and data protection officer</span> is represented by the management of Radinet
				LTD. Data protection department can be reached by e-mail at privacy@radinet.net</p>
			<p><span>2. What personal data are and where we get them from</span>
				“Personal data” are all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person
				(hereinafter referred to as “person concerned”); a natural person is deemed to be identifiable if they
				can directly or indirectly be identified in particular by means of allocation to an identification such
				as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identification or one or more specific
				features that are an expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic,
				cultural or social identity of this natural person.
			</p>
			<span>a) Data that are produced when the website is visited</span>
			<p>You can in principle view our websites without entering any personal data. As a rule, we only store the
				website from which you accessed our website, the name of your internet service provider, which websites
				you visited within our website and the date and duration of your visit. In order to do this, small files
				(known as cookies) are stored in your computer’s memory for the duration of your visit. These are what
				are known as temporary session cookies (for more information on permanent cookies see section 10 below).
				The relevant data are stored on the servers of our service provider LeaseWeb Global B.V. Luttenbergweg
				8, 1101 EC Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The session cookies are automatically deleted as soon as you
				close your browser window. We use the session cookies to create what is known as a session ID for
				internal statistical purposes. The data obtained are fully anonymised, so there is no chance of you
				being identified as a person. Your IP address and a time stamp are stored for security reasons and only
				used for internal purposes. The IP address is a machine-related identification that enables a conclusion
				to be drawn about the computer used to access the internet or the internet gateway used at the time of
				the online inquiry. The term time stamp means a value in a defined format that allocates a time to an
				event (such as the sending or receiving of a message or the modification of data or the like). The
				purpose of a time stamp is to make clear to people or computers when which events occurred.
			</p>
			<span>b) Personal data that you send to us in a form</span>
			<p>We obtain your personal data when you enter these data in a registration or contact form on our website,
				thereby registering for the information and multimedia services. The data that are collected depend on
				which specific service you are interested in.
				Unless otherwise included on the respective form, the following data are collected and stored:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>your full and correct name</li>
				<li>your email address</li>
				<li>your full and correct postal address</li>
				<li>your telephone number</li>
				<li>your date of birth</li>
				<li>your geographical location (country)</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<p>If you have granted consent for advertising when you registered, we will also store your registration
				data (date and time of declaration of consent, IP address, your browser and operating system details,
				device).
			</p>
			<p><span>3. Purposes for which we use your personal data<br /></span>
				According to the GDPR, the Federal Data Protection Act and other laws that regulate data protection, we
				can only process your personal data with your legal consent.</p>
			<p><span>a) Processing for the fulfilment of contractual obligations (Article 6 paragraph 1 b) GDPR</span>
			</p>
			<p>We primarily use and collect your personal data to run the information and multimedia services.</p>
			<p>However, some of your data are also collected for advertising purposes:
			</p>
			<p>if you participate in the information and multimedia services (which is funded by advertising) via the
				online form and grant consent for advertising at the same time, the subject matter of the information
				and multimedia contract concluded also includes the transfer of data for promotional purposes. In this
				case, your contractual consideration is that you grant consent for advertising which enables us and our
				sponsors to provide advertising in the areas mentioned (post, email and telephone advertising). For this
				reason, the data are stored in accordance with Article 6 1 b) GDPR and used by us for advertising
				purposes. The data are then also passed on to the sponsors to provide advertising in the areas
				mentioned. If you terminate the information and multimedia contract, we will then refrain from
				continuing to use these data for advertising purposes.
			</p>
			<p>If you conclude a value added services / information and multimedia contract without obligation on your
				part to grant consent for advertising, the above-mentioned use of the data for advertising purposes will
				not apply.</p>
			<p><span>b) Processing on the basis of your consent (Article 6 paragraph 1 a) GDPR</span></p>
			<p>We also process your data on the basis of consent for advertising if you grant us this consent when
				registering for the information and multimedia. In this case, we use the data ourselves for advertising
				purposes and forward it to our sponsors within the scope of the consent you granted.</p>
			<p><span>c) Processing to protect legitimate interests (Article 6 paragraph 1 1 f) GDPR</span></p>
			<p>If you answer questions after/during registering for the information and multimedia which do not refer to
				a specific product, we will store your answers with your personal data to ensure targeted advertising.
				In the case of answers which do refer to a specific product, we will forward your answer to the relevant
				company.</p>

			<p><span>d) Processing on the basis of legal requirements (Article 6 paragraph 1 c) GDPR</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we process your data to meet our fiscal and commercial accounting and record keeping
				obligations.
			</p>
			<p><span>4. Who receives your data and when they are send to third countries</span>
				In the following sub-points, we explain who we send your data to and when we send the data to what are
				known as third countries. Third countries are countries outside of the European Economic Area. We
				process your data internally in several departments. We primarily send data to external service
				providers as we do not provide some services ourselves or cannot sensibly provide them ourselves. We
				have external service providers that we use for all our data processing and external service providers
				who only receive data if you specifically choose for this data to be sent.
			</p>
			<p><span>4. Who receives your data and when they are send to third countries</span>
				In the following sub-points, we explain who we send your data to and when we send the data to what are
				known as third countries. Third countries are countries outside of the European Economic Area. We
				process your data internally in several departments. We primarily send data to external service
				providers as we do not provide some services ourselves or cannot sensibly provide them ourselves. We
				have external service providers that we use for all our data processing and external service providers
				who only receive data if you specifically choose for this data to be sent.
			</p>
			<p><span>a) Internal recipients and general external service providers</span> Internally, all departments
				which need the data for the above-mentioned purposes have access to your data.</p>
			<p>Data validation</p>
			<p>Newsletter sendings</p>
			<p>We also use external service providers to process the data for these purposes.</p>
			<p>Date-hosting</p>
			<p>If you do not wish for your data to be processed in this or any other way, you can revoke your consent
				for this via email to the address privacy@radinet.net
			</p>
			<p><span>b) Passing on to our sponsors or the providers of specific product offers
				</span></p>
			<p>If you have declared your consent to receive advertising from our sponsors / third parties when
				registering for the information and multimedia services, we may pass your data on to these sponsors.
				However, the data will not be forwarded to all sponsors. Instead, we will select the companies to which
				we send the data. However, we will continue to pass the data on to our sponsors after consent for
				advertising has been revoked where this is necessary to provide evidence of consent that had been
				granted in the past.</p>
			<p>Your data will also be passed on to companies in whose products you have shown a specific interest after
				completion of the registration.</p>
			<p><span>5. Period for which your data will be stored</span>
				The period for which your data will be stored depends on the legal principle of data processing:
			</p>
			<p>Data that we only receive to provide information and multimedia services will be deleted no later than
				three months after the service has been completed. Information and multimedia is deemed to have been
				completed when you have stopped your subscription by sending us relevant information via phone or
				e-mail.</p>
			<p>Data that we have received for promotional purposes will be deleted ten years after the reason for the
				data being stored no longer applies. If you grant us consent for advertising, we will delete your data
				ten years after the revocation or final use of your data. Long storage of this type is necessary as we
				still have to provide evidence that the promotional use by us or our partners was legally admissible
				even after the consent has been revoked. If the consent is revoked before the data have been used for
				advertising purposes, the data will be deleted within a month of consent being revoked.</p>
			<p><span>6. Your rights as a data subject and your revocation of consent</span>
				The General Data Protection Regulation guarantees you certain rights that you can assert over us. You
				have the right:
			</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>to request confirmation from us of whether personal data concerning you are processed and if so the
					specific circumstances of the data processing (<span>Article 15 GDPR: right of access by the data
						subject)</span></li>
				<li>to request that we correct incorrect personal data concerning you immediately. Taking into account
					the purpose of the processing you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete
					personal data, including by means of a supplementary declaration (Article 16 GDPR: right to
					rectification)</li>
				<li>to request that we correct incorrect personal data concerning you immediately. Taking into account
					the purpose of the processing you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete
					personal data, including by means of a supplementary declaration <span>(Article 16 GDPR: right to
						rectification)</span></li>
				<li>to request that we delete personal data concerning you immediately <span>(Article 17 GDPR: right of
						deletion)</span>
				</li>
				<li>to request that we restrict processing <span>(Article 18 GDPR: right to restriction of
						processing)</span></li>
				<li>in the event of processing based on consent or for performance of a contract, to receive the
					personal data concerning you that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and
					machine-readable format and to transmit these data to another responsible without hindrance from us
					or to transmit these data directly to another responsible person where this is technically feasible
					<span>(Article 20 GDPR: right to data portability)</span></li>
				<li>to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of
					personal data that is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or the exercise
					of official authority <span>(Article 21 GDPR: right to object)</span>
				</li>
				<li>to lodge a complaint at any time with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of
					their habitual residence, their workplace or the place of the alleged infringement if you are of the
					opinion that the processing of the personal data concerning you infringes applicable law
					<span>(Article 77 GDPR in combination with Section 19 of the Federal Data Protection Act: right to
						lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have granted us consent, you ultimately have the right to revoke your consent at any time. In this
				case, all data processing carried out by us up to the point at which you revoked your consent remains
				legal. To this end you can simply click on the link in each email and unsubscribe from the email service
				or send an email to privacy@radinet.net. Once you have revoked your consent we will no longer use the
				data you provided for advertising purposes. We will also not pass your data on to third parties for
				advertising purposes.</p>

			<p><span>7. Your obligation to provide personal data</span>
				You are under no contractual or legal obligation to participate in the service. If, however, you choose
				to register online and conclude an information and multimedia contract, you are obliged to grant us
				consent for advertising too. You can, however, take part in the service without granting your consent
				for advertising by sending an email to privacy@radinet.net or a postcard to us. Participant data must be
				provided to receive the service (with or without consent for advertising).</p>
			<p><span>8. Existence of automated decision-making (including profiling)</span>
				We use automated decision-making to send you targeted advertisements if you have granted us consent for
				advertising. We also evaluate the answers you provided during registering for the information and
				multimedia service.
			</p>
			<p><span>9. Security</span>
				We use technical and organisational security measures to ensure that your personal data are protected
				against loss, incorrect modifications and unauthorised access by third parties. In any case, from our
				side it is only authorised persons who have access to your personal data, and they only have this to the
				extent required for the above-mentioned purposes. The security measures are constantly being adapted to
				the improvements in technical possibilities.
			</p>
			<p><span>10. Which internet-specific data processing occurs</span></p>
			<p><span>a) Cookies</span>We use what are known as cookies on our websites. These are small files that are
				saved on your hard disc and through which specific information is sent to us. This information includes
				in particular the login (your visit), the date and time of your visit to us, the cookie number and the
				URL of the website from which you reached our website. The relevant data are stored on our service
				provider’s servers.
			</p>
			<p>The use of cookies initially enables us to recognise you. We can also use the cookies to tailor our
				website to your individual needs in an optimal manner. We also use cookies to record the statistical
				frequency with which the various pages of our website are accessed and the general navigation.</p>
			<p>If, however, you want to prevent the use of cookies, you can use your browser to prevent the acceptance
				and storage of new cookies. You can still use our website if you do this, but there may be a restriction
				in the scope of service. To find out how this works in the browser you use, please use the help function
				in your browser or contact the manufacturer. However, we recommend leaving cookies switched on as this
				is the only way that we can deliver the high level of user comfort we are always striving to achieve.
			</p>
			<p><span>b) Facebook Pixel</span>
				We use Facebook Pixel by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland, on our
				websites. It offers several functions, and we use the Custom Audiences function. This means that if you
				have a Facebook user account our advertisement will be displayed on Facebook in a targeted manner. In
				order to do this, Facebook Pixel creates a direct connection between our website and the Facebook
				servers. Your usage data are sent to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. If you have a
				Facebook account, these data can be attributed to you. Tracking means that under certain circumstances
				your Facebook activity can be tracked by several websites. We have no influence over any processing of
				personal data as this is the sole responsibility of Facebook. You can find more information on the
				collection and use of data by Facebook in the Facebook data protection notice on <a
					href="https://www.facebook.com/policy">https://www.facebook.com/policy</a> If you want to refuse
				consent for the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences, you can change the relevant settings in your
				Facebook user account on:
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads">https://www.facebook.com/ads</a>
			<p><span>c) Google Analytics</span>
				This website uses the web analysis service Google Analytics and the service Google Remarketing, both
				provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Through the Google Remarketing service, users who have already
				visited our websites and online services and shown an interest in what we offer will be appealed to
				again through targeted advertising on Google Partner Network websites. The advertising is overlaid using
				cookies. The text files can be used to analyse user behaviour when visiting the website and then make
				targeted product recommendations and provide advertisements based on interest. Google Analytics also
				uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP
				address) is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Of course we use Google
				Analytics with the function anonymizeIP, so your IP address is absolutely anonymised through masking.

			</p>
			<p>Google will use the information to evaluate your use of the website in order to generate reports on the
				website activity for the website owner in order to provide additional services associated with the use
				of the website and the use of the internet. Google may also transfer this information to third parties
				if required to do so by law or where third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Third party
				providers, including Google, use the information stored in the cookies as part of the Google Remarketing
				service to display advertisements on other websites on the basis of a user’s previous visits to that
				website. Google will not link your IP address to other data held by Google under any circumstances even
				if it is masked.</p>
			<p>You can prevent the installation of the cookies by changing the relevant settings on your browser
				software or by installing a browser add-on (can be accessed via <a
					href="https://tools.google.com">https://tools.google.com</a>); we wish to note, however, that if you
				do this you may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to the full extent. By using
				this website, you agree to the processing of the information collected about you by Google in the manner
				described and for the aforementioned purpose.</p>
